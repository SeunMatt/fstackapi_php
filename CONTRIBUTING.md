============

Found a bug? Wanna Implement a missing feature? Or you have a suggestion or two;
just create an issue with a description of your intentions and we can start from there.

Running The Tests
=================
Your environment should be setup for php development.
I used [Laragon]() as my local environment while building the package.

To run the tests:
- fork the repo
- clone the your fork of the repo
- run `composer install` in the root dir of the cloned repo
- set up the config as specified in the README
- then run
```
"./vendor/bin/phpunit"
```
Implementing Mising Feature
===========================
Before attempting to implement a new feature, first create an issue about it and check to ensure nobody else is working on it.
